# >_ asdMASK

A macOS app to hide or unhide Ableton `.asd` files — keeping your folders clean without deleting.

---

## Why asdMASK?

Ableton Live’s `.asd` files store audio clip analysis data.  
They help performance but clutter your workspace.  
Ableton lets you disable `.asd` creation — but that may impact performance.  

>_ asdMASK offers a simple way to **hide or reveal** these files, so you keep the benefits without the mess.
